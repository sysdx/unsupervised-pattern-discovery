# Unsupervised Pattern Discovery

This repository explores methods for discovering structure
in unlabeled data.

## Why this matters
Many real-world datasets lack labels.
Unsupervised learning reveals hidden groupings,
anomalies, and structure.

## Techniques included
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Pattern visualization

Focus is on interpretation, not just algorithms.
